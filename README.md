# CVAE-Vision-Transformer-for-Alzheimer-Detection
This repository presents a novel hybrid model combining Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for early Alzheimer's Disease detection. The model demonstrates 96% accuracy, even on smaller datasets, offering a powerful tool for healthcare professionals to improve early diagnosis and intervention.
